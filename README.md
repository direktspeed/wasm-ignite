# wasm-ignite
wasm modules to build an in-memory computing platform used for transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads, delivering in-memory speed at petabyte scale. with optional persistence support

# Why?
Because Apache Ignite combines nice concepts i think it should be a wasm so it can be used inside nodejs or any other wasm runtime

as this is coded probally at present in rust we will try on best effort base to support rust only usage also.
